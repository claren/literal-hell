# literal-hell

**Escape the pain. One string at a time.**

A command-line exorcist for HTML entity hellscapes. It hunts down unescaped string literals (quotes, ampersands, angle bracketsâ€”-the usual suspects) and helps you fix them before the linter explodes, Vercel has a panic attack, or the browser cries. Interactive, fast, and just smart enough to run for office.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g literal-hell

# Or install locally in your project
npm install --save-dev literal-hell
```

Requirements:
- Node.js 14.x or higher

## Usage

Run the tool in your project directory:

```bash
# Basic usage
literal-hell

# Get help
literal-hell --help   # or -h

# Show version information
literal-hell --version   # or -v

# Show detailed logs
literal-hell --verbose

# Force prompt for all fixes (no auto-skipping)
literal-hell --strict

# Clear rejection history (re-check previously skipped items)
literal-hell --clear-history
```

### Interactive Commands

When prompted about a potential fix:
- Press `y` (or Enter): Apply the fix
- Press `n`: Skip this fix and remember for future runs
- Press `q`: Save changes and exit
- Press `c`: Show surrounding code context before deciding

By default, the tool will auto-skip common patterns like CSS selectors, font declarations, and URL parameters. Use `--strict` to review all potential fixes.

## How It Works

The tool:
1. Scans JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files in your project
2. Detects string literals that need HTML entity escaping
3. Interactively prompts you to apply fixes
4. Remembers which fixes you've rejected to avoid re-prompting
5. Auto-skips common patterns that don't need escaping

Escaped characters:
- `"` becomes `&quot;`
- `'` becomes `&apos;`
- `&` becomes `&amp;`
- `<` becomes `&lt;`
- `>` becomes `&gt;`

### Generated Files

The tool creates a `.literal-hell-wards` file in your project directory to store:
- Fixes you've explicitly rejected
- Patterns automatically skipped by the detection system

It's recommended to add this file to your `.gitignore`:

```
# literal-hell history file
.literal-hell-wards
```

This prevents the rejection history from being shared between developers, as preferences for which strings to escape may vary across projects and teams.
