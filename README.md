# literal-hell

**Escape the pain. One string at a time.**

A command-line exorcist for HTML entity hellscapes. It hunts down unescaped string literals (quotes, ampersands, angle bracketsâ€”-the usual suspects) and helps you fix them before the linter explodes, Vercel has a panic attack, or the browser cries. Interactive, fast, and just smart enough to run for office.

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g literal-hell

# Or install locally in your project
npm install --save-dev literal-hell
```

Requirements:
- Node.js 14.x or higher

## Usage

Run the tool in your project directory:

```bash
# Basic usage
literal-hell

# Get help
literal-hell --help   # or -h

# Show version information
literal-hell --version   # or -v

# Show detailed logs
literal-hell --verbose

# Force prompt for all fixes (no auto-skipping)
literal-hell --strict

# Clear rejection history (re-check previously skipped items)
literal-hell --clear-history
```

### Interactive Commands

When prompted about a potential fix:
- Press `y` (or Enter): Apply the fix
- Press `n`: Skip this fix and remember for future runs
- Press `q`: Save changes and exit
- Press `c`: Show surrounding code context before deciding

By default, the tool will auto-skip common patterns like CSS selectors, font declarations, and URL parameters. Use `--strict` to review all potential fixes.

## How It Works

The tool:
1. Scans JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files in your project
2. Detects string literals that need HTML entity escaping
3. Interactively prompts you to apply fixes
4. Remembers which fixes you've rejected to avoid re-prompting
5. Auto-skips common patterns that don't need escaping

Escaped characters:
- `"` becomes `&quot;`
- `'` becomes `&apos;`
- `&` becomes `&amp;`
- `<` becomes `&lt;`
- `>` becomes `&gt;`

### Generated Files

The tool creates a `.literal-hell-wards` file in your project directory to store:
- Fixes you've explicitly rejected
- Patterns automatically skipped by the detection system

It's recommended to add this file to your `.gitignore`:

```
# literal-hell history file
.literal-hell-wards
```

This prevents the rejection history from being shared between developers, as preferences for which strings to escape may vary across projects and teams.

## For Developers

### Code Structure

The tool is organized into several modules in the `src/lib` directory:

- `index.js` - Main entry point that handles CLI arguments and orchestrates the process
- `eslint.js` - ESLint integration using Vercel's Next.js ESLint config to find unescaped entities
- `processor.js` - Core file processing logic, handles applying fixes and user interaction
- `ast.js` - AST traversal for finding string literals that need escaping
- `fixes.js` - Manages the rejection history and fix tracking
- `ui.js` - User interface components (context display, keypress handling)
- `logger.js` - Logging utilities with color-coded output
- `file.js` - File I/O operations and safety checks
- `escape.js` - String escaping logic and pattern detection
- `config.js` - Global configuration and constants

### How It Works

1. **File Discovery**
   - Uses `globby` to find JavaScript/TypeScript files
   - Ignores common directories like `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`

2. **Entity Detection**
   - Primary method: Uses ESLint with Vercel's Next.js config to find unescaped entities
   - Fallback method: AST traversal for string literals and JSX text nodes
   - Detects quotes (`'`, `"`), ampersands (`&`), and angle brackets (`<`, `>`)

3. **Fix Processing**
   - Groups fixes by file for efficient processing
   - Shows context around each fix (3 lines by default, 7 lines with 'c')
   - Handles both JSX text nodes and string literals differently
   - Preserves whitespace and formatting
   - Prevents double-escaping of already escaped entities

4. **Safety Features**
   - Verifies file modifications before writing
   - Checks for corrupted escapes
   - Handles multiline text carefully
   - Preserves JSX tags and attributes
   - Tracks rejected fixes to avoid re-prompting

5. **User Interaction**
   - Interactive prompts for each fix
   - Context viewing with line numbers
   - Clear success/error messages
   - Progress logging with color coding

### Development

To work on the tool:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/claren/literal-hell.git
cd literal-hell

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test

# Build
npm run build

# Link for local development
npm link
```

### Adding Features

When adding new features:
1. Follow the modular structure
2. Add appropriate logging
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Update tests (when implemented)
5. Document changes in README

### Key Design Decisions

1. **ESLint Integration**
   - Uses Vercel's Next.js ESLint config to match production behavior
   - Falls back to AST traversal if ESLint fails
   - Processes all files in a single ESLint run for efficiency

2. **Fix Application**
   - Processes fixes from end to start to avoid position shifts
   - Different handling for JSX vs string literals
   - Preserves file formatting and whitespace

3. **User Experience**
   - Shows context by default
   - Color-coded output
   - Clear success/error messages
   - Interactive but non-blocking

4. **Safety**
   - Verifies changes before writing
   - Prevents double-escaping
   - Handles file modifications
   - Preserves JSX structure
